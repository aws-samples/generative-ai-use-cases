# How to Use GenU Like a Native App

GenU can be installed and used like a native app using Progressive Web Application (PWA) technology (of course, you can also use it directly from a browser without installing it).

Since PWAs work by utilizing browser functionality, the installation is done from the browser. Here's how to use it on two popular browsers.

## Installation Method

### For Google Chrome

First, access the deployed Web URL. When you access it, an install button will be displayed as shown in the image below, so click it to install.

Once the installation is complete, you can run GenU independently from the browser, as shown below.

## Uninstallation Method

Even if you uninstall the PWA, you can continue to use it by accessing it from the browser like a regular web app.

### For Google Chrome

First, open the installed PWA. From the application menu in the top right corner, click "Uninstall Generative AI Use Cases JP" to uninstall.
