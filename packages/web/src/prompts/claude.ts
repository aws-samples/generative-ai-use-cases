The content enclosed in the <FAQ> tags below is the FAQ that you will reference when providing answers.
<FAQ>
Q:What is Amazon Kendra?
A:Amazon Kendra is a highly accurate and easy-to-use enterprise search service that’s powered by machine learning (ML). It allows developers to add search capabilities to their applications so their end users can discover information stored within the vast amount of content spread across their company. This includes data from manuals, research reports, FAQs, human resources (HR) documentation, and customer service guides, which may be found across various systems such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Microsoft SharePoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, RDS databases, or Microsoft OneDrive. When you type a question, the service uses ML algorithms to understand the context and return the most relevant results, whether that means a precise answer or an entire document. For example, you can ask a question such as "How much is the cash reward on the corporate credit card?” and Amazon Kendra will map to the relevant documents and return a specific answer (such as “2%”). Kendra provides sample code so you can get started quickly and easily integrate highly accurate search into your new or existing applications.
Q:How does Amazon Kendra work with other AWS services?
A:Amazon Kendra provides ML-powered search capabilities for all unstructured data that you store in AWS. Amazon Kendra offers easy-to-use native connectors to popular AWS repository types such as Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS databases. Other AI services such as Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Transcribe, and Amazon Comprehend Medical can be used to pre-process documents, generate searchable text, extract entities, and enrich metadata for more-specialized search experiences.
Q:What types of questions will Amazon Kendra be unable to answer?
A:Amazon Kendra does not yet support questions where the answers require cross-document passage aggregation or calculations.
Q:How do I get up and running with Amazon Kendra?
A:The Amazon Kendra console provides the easiest way to get started. You can point Amazon Kendra at unstructured and semi-structured documents such as FAQs stored in Amazon S3. After ingestion, you can start testing Kendra by typing queries directly in the “search” section of the console. You can then deploy Amazon Kendra search in two easy ways: (1) use the visual UI editor in our Experience Builder (no code required), or (2) implement the Amazon Kendra API using a few lines of code for more-precise control. Code samples are also provided in the console to speed up API implementation.
Q:How can I customize Amazon Kendra to better fit my company’s domain or business specialty?
A:Amazon Kendra offers domain-specific expertise for IT, pharma, insurance, energy, industrial, financial services, legal, media and entertainment, travel and hospitality, health, human resources, news, telecommunications, and automotive. You can further fine-tune and extend Kendra's domain-specific understanding by providing your own synonym lists. Simply upload a file with your specific terminology, and Amazon Kendra will use these synonyms to enrich user searches.
Q:What file types does Amazon Kendra support?
A:Amazon Kendra supports unstructured and semi-structured data in .html, MS Office (.doc, .ppt), PDF, and text formats. With the MediaSearch solution, you can also use Amazon Kendra to search audio and video files.
Q:How does Amazon Kendra handle incremental data updates?
A:Amazon Kendra provides two methods of keeping your index up to date. First, connectors provide scheduling to automatically sync your data sources on a regular basis. Second, the Amazon Kendra API allows you to build your own connector to send data directly to Amazon Kendra from your data source via your existing ETL jobs or applications.
Q:What languages does Amazon Kendra support?
A:For information on language support, refer to this documentation page.
Q:What code changes do I need to make to use Amazon Kendra?
A:Ingesting content does not require coding when using the native connectors. You can also write your own custom connectors to integrate with other data sources, using the Amazon Kendra SDK. You can deploy Amazon Kendra search in two easy ways: (1) use the visual UI editor in our Experience Builder (no code required), or (2) implement the Kendra API using a few lines of code for more flexibility. Code samples are also provided in the console to speed up API implementation. The SDK provides full control and flexibility of the end-user experience.
Q:In what regions is Amazon Kendra available?
A:See the AWS Regional Services page for more details.
Q:Can I add custom connectors?
A:You can write your own connectors using the Amazon Kendra Custom Data Source API. In addition, Amazon Kendra has a search-expert partner ecosystem that can help build connectors currently not available from AWS. Please contact us for more details on our partner network.
Q:How does Amazon Kendra handle security?
A:Amazon Kendra encrypts your data in transit and at rest. You have three choices for encryption keys for data at rest: AWS-owned KMS key, AWS-managed KMS key in your account, or a customer-managed KMS key. For data in transit, Amazon Kendra uses the HTTPS protocol to communicate with your client application. API calls to access Amazon Kendra through the network use Transport Layer Security (TLS) that must be supported by the client.
Q:Can Amazon Kendra find answers from the content of audio and video recordings?
A:Yes, MediaSearch solution combines Amazon Kendra with Amazon Transcribe and enables users to search for relevant answers embedded in audio and video content.

Act as a math tutor
</Task>
<Inputs>
{$MATH QUESTION}
</Inputs>
<Instructions>
A student is working on a math problem. Please act as a brilliant mathematician and "Socratic Tutor" for this student to help them learn. As a socratic tutor, the student will describe to you their partial progress on a mathematical question to you. If the student has completed the question correctly, tell them so and give them a nice compliment. If the student has not yet completed the question correctly, give them a hint about the next step they should take in order to solve the problem. If the student has made an error in their reasoning, gently ask the student a question in a way that indicates the error, but give the student space to figure out the answer on their own. Before your first response to the student, use your internal monologue to solve the problem by thinking step by step. Before each response, use your internal monologue to determine if the student's last work is correct by re-solving the problem completely starting from their last mathematical expression, and checking to see if the answer equals your original answer. Use that to guide your answer, referring back to your original solution. Make sure to think carefully about exactly where the student has made their mistake.

<example>
<Student> I'm working on -4(2 - x) = 8. I got to -8-4x=8, but I'm not sure what to do next.</Student>
<Socratic Tutor (Claude)>
<Inner monologue> First, I will solve the problem myself, thinking step by step.
-4(2 - x) = 8
2 - x = -2
x = 4

Now, I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is -8 - 4x = 8, and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
-8-4x=8
-4x = 16
x = -4
The entailed solution does not match my original result, so the student must have made a mistake. It looks like they did not do the associative multiplication correctly.
</Inner monologue>
Have you double-checked that you multiplied each term by negative 4 correctly?</Socratic Tutor>
<Student> Ah! I see. I should have written -8 + 4x = 8.<Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is -8 + 4x = 8, and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
-8 + 4x = 8
4x = 16
x = 4
This matches my original computation that x = 4, so it looks like the student's work is correct.
</Inner monologue>
Great job correcting your mistake. What do you think you should do next?</Socratic Tutor>
<Student> I don't know, do you have any suggestions?/Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner monologue>
Give the student a small hint to help them solve the problem.
</Inner monologue>
Why don't you see if you can get X by itself?</Socratic Tutor>
<Student> OK, I subtract 8 from both sides, 4x = 0, so x = 0. </Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is x = 0, and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
x = 0
This does not match my original result that x = 4, so it looks like the student's work is incorrect.
</Inner monologue>
Hmm, did you really subtract 8 from both sides?</Socratic Tutor>
<Student> Ohh, I need to add 8 to both sides. 4x = 16. x = 4.</Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is x = 4, and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
x = 4.
My original result was x = 4. The results match.
</Inner monologue>
Wonderful job! That's exactly right.</Socratic Tutor>
</example>
<example>
<Student> I'm trying to find an equation that will go through the points ( 3, 8 ) and ( 1, 2 ). Can you please help me?</Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner monologue> To find the equation that goes through the points (3,8) and (1,2), I will use the point slope formula:
y - y1 = m(x - x1)

Where m is the slope between the two points:

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

For the points (3,8) and (1,2):

x1 = 3, y1 = 8
x2 = 1, y2 = 2

Plugging this in:

m = (2 - 8) / (1 - 3) = -6/-2 = 3

Using the point slope formula with (3,8):

y - 8 = 3(x - 3)
y - 8 = 3x - 9
y = 3x - 1

Therefore, the equation is y = 3x - 1
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last mathematical expression, which is... Hmm, the student has not yet written any expressions. Point them in the right direction.
</Inner monologue>
As a next step, think about how you can calculate the slope between those two points. That will help you determine the equation. </Socratic Tutor>
<Student> Slope = rise over run. So the slope would be (8 - 3) / (2 - 1). Slope = 5.</Student>
<Inner Monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is "slope = 5", and deriving the answer that expression would entail. Let's think step by step to see if a slope of 8 would result in the correct formula. Point-slope form is
y - y1 = slope(x - x1)
y - 8 = 5(x - 3)
y = 5x - 7.
That is not the same as my original equation. So the student must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's think about where. The student calculated the slope with (8 - 3) / (2 - 1). The proper formula is (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). In this case, y2 = 2, y1 = 8, x2 = 1, x1 = 3. Tell the student to make sure they have calculated slope correctly.
</Inner Monologue>
Are you sure you've calculated the slope correctly? Remember, rise over run = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) </Socratic Tutor>
<Student> Ah! I see. It should be (8 - 2) / (3 - 1) = 6/2 = 3. Slope is 3. Can you help tell me what to do next?</Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner Monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is "Slope is 3", and deriving the answer that expression would entail. If the slope is 3, then point-slope form means:
y - 8 = 3(x - 3)
y - 8 = 3x - 9
y = 3x - 1
The original solution I calculated was also y = 3x - 1. Therefore the student is on the right track. Give them a hint about what to do next. </Inner Monologue>
Good work calculating the slope. Now you can use point-slope form: y - y1 = slope(x - x1). </Socratic Tutor>
<Student> y - 2 = 3(x - 1)
y - 2 = 3x - 3
y = 3x - 1</Student>
<Inner Monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is y = 3x - 1, and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
y = 3x - 1
My original answer was y = 3x - 1. The two equations match. Compliment the student. </Inner Monologue>
Great work! You found the formula. Feel free to double-check to make sure it goes through the other point. </Socratic Tutor>
</example>
<example>
<Student> Can you help me differentiate f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 3? </Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner monologue> To differentiate f(x) = 3(x^2) - 4x + 3, I will use the power rule, constant multiple rule, and summation rule: f'(x) = 6x - 4
Now I will double check the student's work so far. The student has not shown any work yet, so I will guide them to start differentiating using the appropriate rules.
</Inner monologue>

It looks like you are trying to find the derivative of a polynomial function. As a first step, think about what rules you can use to differentiate each term. The power rule will be useful for differentiating x^2.
</Socratic Tutor>
<Student> Can you remind me of the power rule? </Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner Monologue> The power rule states that the derivative of x^n is: nx^(n-1) </Inner Monologue>
The power rule is:
The derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1)

For example, the derivative of x^2 is 2x.

Does this help remind you of how to apply the power rule? Let me know if you need any clarification on how to start differentiating the function using that rule.
</Socratic Tutor>
<Student> OK, so using the power rule, the derivative of 3(x ^ 2) would be 6x. And the derivative of -4x would be 4. So my solution would be 6x - 4 + 3 </Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner Monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is 6x - 4 + 3, and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
6x - 4 + 3
6x - 1
My original solution was 6x - 4, so the student has made a mistake. It seems they forgot to take the derivative of the 3 term.
</Inner Monologue>
Can you make sure you took the derivative of all the terms? </Socratic Tutor>
<Student> Ah! I forgot to make the 3 a 0. </Student>
<Socratic Tutor>
<Inner Monologue>
I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is "make the 3 a 0", and deriving the answer that expression would entail.
6x - 4 + 3, making the 3 a 0, yields 6x - 4
My original solution was 6x - 4, so the student has the correct answer.
</Inner Monologue>
Terrific! You've solved the problem. </Socratic Tutor>

Are you ready to act as a Socratic tutor? Remember: begin each inner monologue [except your very first, where you solve the problem yourself] by double-checking the student's work carefully. Use this phrase in your inner monologues: "I will double-check the student's work by assuming their last expression, which is ..., and deriving the answer that expression would entail."

I have double checked and made sure that I have been provided the get_ticker_symbol and the get_current_stock_price functions.
</scratchpad>

<function_call>get_ticker_symbol(company_name="The General Motors Company LLC")</function_call>

<error>TickerNotFound: If no matching ticker symbol is found.</error>

<scratchpad>The get_ticker_symbol(company_name="The General Motors Company LLC") call raised a TickerNotFound: If no matching ticker symbol is found error indicating that the provided str did not return a matching ticker symbol. I should retry the function using another name variation of the company.</scratchpad>

<function_call>get_ticker_symbol(company_name="General Motors")</function_call>

<function_result>GM</function_result>

<function_call>get_current_stock_price(symbol="GM")</function_call>

<function_result>38.50</function_result>

<answer>
The current stock price of General Motors is $38.50.

Notice in this example, the initial function call raised an error. Utilizing the scratchpad, you can think about how to address the error and retry the function call or try a new function call in order to gather the necessary information.

Here's a final example where the question asked could not be answered with the provided functions. In this example, notice how you respond without using any functions that are not provided to you.

<example>
<functions>
<function>
<function_name>get_current_stock_price</function_name>
<function_description>Gets the current stock price for a company</function_description>
<required_argument>symbol (str): The stock symbol of the company to get the price for.</required_argument>
<returns>float: The current stock price</returns>
<raises>ValueError: If the input symbol is invalid/unknown</raises>
<example_call>get_current_stock_price(symbol='AAPL')</example_call>
</function>
<function>
<function_name>get_ticker_symbol</function_name>
<function_description> Returns the stock ticker symbol for a company searched by name. </function_description>
<required_argument> company_name (str): The name of the company. </required_argument>
<returns> str: The ticker symbol for the company stock. </returns>
<raises>TickerNotFound: If no matching ticker symbol is found.</raises>

<question>What is the current exchange rate for USD to Euro?</question>

<scratchpad>
After reviewing the functions I was equipped with I realize I am not able to accurately answer this question since I can't access the current exchange rate for USD to Euro. Therefore, I should explain to the user I cannot answer this question.
</scratchpad>

<answer>
Unfortunately, I don't know the current exchange rate from USD to Euro.
</answer>
</example>

This example shows how you should respond to questions that cannot be answered using information from the functions you are provided with. Remember, DO NOT use any functions that I have not provided you with.

Remember, your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using only the function(s) provided to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question.

Do not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling get_current_temp() with additional parameters would be modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.

The result of a function call will be added to the conversation history as an observation. If necessary, you can make multiple function calls and use all the functions I have equipped you with. Always return your final answer within <answer> tags.

</Instructions>
</Task Instruction Example>

That concludes the examples. 

To write your instructions, follow THESE instructions:
1. In <Inputs> tags, write down the barebones, minimal, nonoverlapping set of text input variable(s) the instructions will make reference to. (These are variable names, not specific instructions.) Some tasks may require only one input variable; rarely will more than two-to-three be required.
2. In <Instructions Structure> tags, plan out how you will structure your instructions. In particular, plan where you will include each variable -- remember, input variables expected to take on lengthy values should come BEFORE directions on what to do with them.
3. Finally, in <Instructions> tags, write the instructions for the AI assistant to follow. These instructions should be similarly structured as the ones in the examples above.

Note: This is probably obvious to you already, but you are not *completing* the task here. You are writing instructions for an AI to complete the task.
Note: Another name for what you are writing is a "prompt template". When you put a variable name in brackets + dollar sign into this template, it will later have the full value (which will be provided by a user) substituted into it. This only needs to happen once for each variable. You may refer to this variable later in the template, but do so without the brackets or the dollar sign. Also, it's best for the variable to be demarcated by XML tags, so that the AI knows where the variable starts and ends.
Note: When instructing the AI to provide an output (e.g. a score) and a justification or reasoning for it, always ask for the justification before the score.
Note: If the task is particularly complicated, you may wish to instruct the AI to think things out beforehand in scratchpad or inner monologue XML tags before it gives its final answer. For simple tasks, omit this.
Note: If you want the AI to output its entire response or parts of its response inside certain tags, specify the name of these tags (e.g. "write your answer inside <answer> tags") but do not include closing tags or unnecessary open-and-close tag sections.`,
            prompt: `<Task>
