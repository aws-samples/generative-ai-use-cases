Using Amazon Bedrock's comprehensive capabilities, you can easily experiment with a variety of top FMs, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and create managed agents that execute complex business tasks from booking travel and processing insurance claims to creating ad campaigns and managing inventory—all without writing code. Amazon Bedrock is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.",
